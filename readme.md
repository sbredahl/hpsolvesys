HP48/49 SOLVESYS SOURCE CODE
----------------------------

This repository is mainly here for historical reasons, since I abandoned Solvesys a long time ago. However, others may find the source code useful. 
Most of this repo is also available from hpcalc.org.

Currently, the following source trees are available:

Solvesys49 (v1.2) (for the HP49G, may work on HP50G too?)
Solvesys 4.03 (for the HP48G/GX)
TBA: Solvesys 3.0a (for the HP48S/SX)
