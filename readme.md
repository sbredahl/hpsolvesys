HP48/49 SOLVESYS SOURCE CODE
----------------------------

The repository is mainly for historical reasons as the code is no longer maintained. In particular, don't
expect pull requests to have any effect!

Except for the HP48S version, all source code have previously been published to [link] (http://www.hpcalc.org).

Currently, the following source trees are available:

* Solvesys49 (v1.2) (for the HP49G, may work on HP50G too?)
* Solvesys 4.03 (for the HP48G/GX)
* Stksolve 3.0a (stack-based solver that works on HP48S/SX)

All code is licenced under GPLv3.
