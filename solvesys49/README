Copenhagen, June 2008

SOLVESYS 49 1.2 is hereby released as free open-source software under the GNUv3 license. 
In other words, you are free to modify/hack/tweak/optimize my code in any way you like and/or 
release your own code based on SOLVESYS *provided* that you publish the source code as well.

Except for the inclusion of the GPL, the source code is completely untouched as I left it almost 
8 years ago, including (lack of) comments, abandoned code, typos and everything.

To actually build the source, you'll have to modify the project file "solve49.hpp" as file locations
will be different in your setup. The output binary is named "solve49.hp" which is identical to 
the last and final "solvesys.lib" released 17/07-2000 (md5: a8852ef74c40bc22e8def3aed2ae8699).

Although you're welcome to contact me by e-mail if you have any questions, please respect that I stopped
developing code for the HP48/HP49 many years ago and cannot provide any support for SOLVESYS and/or the
source code. 
 

Happy hacking!
