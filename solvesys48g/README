Copenhagen, November 2012.

I recently discovered the Droid48 emulator for Android and was happy to see that my ol'
HP48G Solvesys library was indeed still working (and now much faster!). 

Also, I "discovered" that I had never released the system rpl source code for this library, unlike the HP49 version source which was released some years ago.

So here it is, licensed under GPLv3, the original and untouched source of the Solvesys 4.03 library (released August 31 1999) which was the final version I did for the HP48G.

I can't really provide any build instructions but I've included the script used to compile the library, so take a look at that if you really need to know.
